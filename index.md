This site contains the breakdown of the curriculum for the Futures Fund's level II coding class.
The class is designed to cover the principles of backend web development.

[Ruby on Rails](http://rubyonrails.org/) is the web development framework chosen for this class.
We chose it not because we expect students leaving the course to enter a career in Rails development, but because we believe the Rails ecosystem is a good place to teach the principles of backend web development.
In fact, we hope that our class will equip students with the tools they need to quickly learn and adapt to other web application frameworks rather than simply produce proficient Rails programmers.
